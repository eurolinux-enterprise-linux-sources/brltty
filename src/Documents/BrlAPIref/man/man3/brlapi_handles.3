.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Each function provided by BrlAPI comes in two versions.
.PP
1. A version whose name is prefixed by brlapi_ for clients opening only one simultaneous connection with BrlAPI (most frequen case)
.PP
2. A version whose name is prefixed by brlapi__ for use by clients wishing to open more than one connection to BrlAPI.
.PP
A function called brlapi__foo is used in exactly the same way as its brlapi_foo counterpart, except that it takes an additional argument (the first one), which is a handle letting the client refer to a given connection in a similar manner to what file descriptors do.
.PP
In case you want to check that your code is not erroneously using brlapi_foo functions, define BRLAPI_NO_SINGLE_SESSION before including <\fBbrlapi.h\fP>: that will disable the declaration of all single session functions.
