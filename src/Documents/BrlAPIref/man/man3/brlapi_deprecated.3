.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
With version 0.5.0, BrlAPI is now provided through including <\fBbrlapi.h\fP> and got a big renaming pass. Old names are still available through macros, but they are deprecated since they will get dropped in the next release. This documentation is for you to know the new names.
.PP
For checking that you have completely switched to new names, just define BRLAPI_NO_DEPRECATED: that will disable compatibility macros.
