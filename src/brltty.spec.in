Summary: Braille display driver for Linux/Unix.
%description
BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides access to
the console screen (when in text mode) for a blind person using a
refreshable braille display.  It drives the braille display, and
provides complete screen review functionality.  Some speech capability
has also been incorporated.

Install this package if you use a refreshable braille display.

Summary: Headers, static archive, and documentation for BrlAPI.
%description -n brlapi-devel
This package provides the header files, static archive, shared object
linker reference, and reference documentation for BrlAPI (the
Application Programming Interface to BRLTTY).  It enables the
implementation of applications which take direct advantage of a
refreshable braille display in order to present information in ways
which are more appropriate for blind users and/or to provide user
interfaces which are more specifically atuned to their needs.

Install this package if you're developing or maintaining an application
which directly accesses a refreshable braille display.
