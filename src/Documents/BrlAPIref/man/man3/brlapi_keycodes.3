.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Key codes are unsigned 64 bit integers. This 64-bit space is split into 3 parts:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
bits 63-32 (BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK), flags: bits 39-32 are standard X modifiers (shift, control, meta, ...). Other flags are used for some commands, see documentation of BRLAPI_KEY_FLG_* for their respective uses.
.IP "\(bu" 2
bits 31-29 (BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK), key type: either BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_CMD for braille commands, or BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM for standard X keysyms.
.IP "\(bu" 2
bits 28-0 (BRLAPI_KEY_CODE_MASK), key code: for braille commands, see BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_* ; for standard X keysyms, this is the keysym value, see X11 documentation, a complete list is probably available on your system in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
.PP
.PP
The third part is itself split into two parts: a command number and a command value. The relative sizes of these parts vary according to the key type.
.PP
For a braille command, bits 28-16 (BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_BLK_MASK) hold the braille command number, while bits 15-0 (BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_ARG_MASK) hold the command value.
.PP
For a X keysym, if it is a unicode keysym (0x1uvwxyz), then the command number part is 0x1000000 and the value part is 0xuvwxyz. Else, the command part is held by bits 28-8 and the value part is held by bits 7-0. This permits to easily handle usual cases like 0x00xy (latin1), 0x01xy (latin2), XK_Backspace (0xff08, backspace), XK_Tab (0xff09, tab), ...
.PP
For instance, if key == 0x0000000020010008,
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_CMD, so it's a braille command
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_BLK_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_ROUTE, so it's the braille route command.
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_ARG_MASK) == 8, so the highlighted cell is the 9th one (cells are numbered from 0)
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK) == 0, so no modifier key was pressed during the command, and no particular flag applies to the command.
.PP
.PP
if key == 0x000000010000FF09,
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM, so it's a keysym
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_CODE_MASK) == XK_Tab, so it's the tab key. BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_TAB can also be used here, as well as a few other BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_* constants which are provided to avoid having to include X11/keysymdef.h
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_FLG_SHIFT, so the shift modifier was pressed during the command.
.PP
.PP
in the X11 standard some keysyms are directly unicode, for instance if key == 0x0000000001001EA0,
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM, so it's a keysym
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_UNICODE) != 0 so it's a unicode keysym, whose value is key & (BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_UNICODE-1). Of course, one can also consider (key & BRLAPI_KEY_CODE_MASK) == XK_Abelowdot
.IP "\(bu" 2
(key & BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK) == 0, so no modifier key was pressed during the command, and no particular flag applies to the command.
